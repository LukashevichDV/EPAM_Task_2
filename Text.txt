Little Andy's mother is not at home, she is at work. Andy is hungry.
 He wants to have some nice things for lunch. He opens the fridge and sees two bananas and some grapes. 
He doesn't like grapes, but he likes bananas very much, so he takes them. He sees a bottle of Coca Cola.
 "Oh, good!" he thinks. In the cupboard there is a jar of apricot jam. "That's my favourite", says Andy.
 He eats the jam, the two bananas and drinks the Coca Cola.
 When his mother comes home, she sees Andy on the sofa. The little boy is not well.
 "Oh, Andy", his mother says, "Coca-Cola and jam are not good for you. You should eat healthy food."
